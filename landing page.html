                <h2>About Us</h2>
                <p>We are the growers of authentic Devgad Hapus also known as the Alphonso, widely savored as the best mango in the world. We have joined forces as the Deogad Taluka Amba Utpadak Sahakari Sanstha Limited (Or Devgad Taluka Amba Utpadak Sahakari Sanstha Limited), co-operative society of over 700 Alphonso-growers in the Devgad Taluka. Our aim is to work for the benefit of all growers, farmers of Alphonso mango.
                   Our prime objective is to ensure a market for our Alphonso in major cities in the country at the right India. We have a modern grading-packing facility and a cold-storage plant at Devgad. We choose the best fruit for sale as table fruit and the rest is sent to the processing factories.
                    
                    Devgad produces the king of Alphonso and just like a king, it requires cultivation with utmost care. So we also help our members with knowledge of best cultivation practices, supply them with fertilizers, and pesticides, and help them take care of their orchards. We are also the link between our members and the state government, agricultural universities, government agencies, etc. It is registered under the Maharashtra Co-operative Societies Act 1960 vide</p>
